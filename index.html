      <h3 id="landing">Landing Page</h3>
      <h4>Mock Up</h4>

      <img src="images/mockups/landingmobilemockup.png" alt="landing page mockup" class="mobilewf">
      <p>The changes made to the Landing Page was the remove of the circle in the centre of the main banner and the lines between the campaign photos. Feedback revealed that the circle would suggest that the user had to pull it down to extend the banner and the lines posed no purpose for the page. The arrow next to the donate button was removed because users were led to believe it would swipe to the right as a transition. The Solar Citizens logo also acts as a Landing Page link. The Solar Citizens logo in the header acts as a About Page Link where as the image and Stop the Sun Tax word are links to the Campaign Page. For the mobile version of the page, the text was removed from the campaign panel as it was too similar to the mobile Campaign page. The mobile version makes the campaigns salient since DesCo wanted to highlight the purpose of Solar Citizens - campaigning for renewable energy. </p>
      <h4>Website/Mobile</h4>

      <blockquote>
        The circle seems like a pull tab and something will pop up.

      <h3 id="about">About Page</h3>
      <h4>Mock Up</h4>
      <img src="images/mockups/aboutdesktopmockup.png" alt="about page mockup" class="websitewf">
      <img src="images/mockups/aboutmobilemockup.png" alt="about page mockup" class="mobilewf">
      <p>The mock up desktop page was executed almost exactly the same besides the content which included a video but was placed in the same area as the image in the mock up. Users found the About Page on desktop easy to navigate and use. The mobile version of the website was slightly changed where the information was no longer placed on a panel as it restricted the content within. The circle of the header was also removed since it covered unnecessary space. An issue with the mobile version was the placement of the video had a margin-right that was unable to be fixed and caused it to be shifted far left. </p>
      <h4>Website/Mobile</h4>
			<img src="images/real/real-about.png" alt="about page desktop" class="websitemk">
      <img src="images/real/real-about2.png" alt="about page desktop" class="websitemk">
      <img src="images/real/real-mabout.PNG" alt="about page mobile" class="mobilemk">
      <img src="images/real/real-mabout2.PNG" alt="about page mobile" class="mobilemk">
      <h3 id="campaign">Campaign Page</h3>
      <h4>Mock Up</h4>
      <img src="images/mockups/campaigndesktopmockup.png" alt="campaign page mockup" class="websitewfu">
      <img src="images/mockups/campaignmobilemockup.png" alt="campaign page mockup" class="mobilewfu">
      <p>The Campaign Page was kept mostly the same with the exception changing of the signing button as Rob suggested to make the buttons bigger to make it more appealing for calls to action and to make the text different to indicate to the user that there are different petitions to sign. The mobile version was tried to be kept the same but there was many issues with trying to fix it as the containers and sections kept overlapping and the final execution was not usable. </p>
      <h4>Website/Mobile</h4>
			<img src="images/real/real-camp.png" alt="camp page desktop" class="websitemk">
      <img src="images/real/real-mcamp.PNG" alt="camp page mobile" class="mobilemk">
      <img src="images/real/real-mcamp2.PNG" alt="camp page mobile" class="mobilemk">
      <blockquote>
        Consider making the 'sign petition' button bigger so it is a more clear call to action. Might be better to say 'sign this petition' as well to make it clear there are multiple petitions.  
			</blockquote>
			<h3 id="join">Join Page</h3>
      <h4>Mock up</h4>
      <img src="images/mockups/joindesktopmockup.png" alt="join page mockup" class="websitewf">
      <img src="images/mockups/joinmobilemockup.png" alt="join mobile mockup" class="mobilewf">
      <p>The Join Page was kept the same with some minor additions to the page such as the petition checkboxes, which was linked from the campaigns page. DesCo wanted to provide a quick sign option so we connected it in the sign up form. The text within the sign up button was also changed to "I'M IN" since the current Solar Citizen's website also has that and we wanted to incorporate a feeling of participating in a greater good. After the user had pressed the button, they are prompted with a message saying "You're In!". The mobile version was relatively the same as the desktop counterpart but with small issues of alignment.</p>
      <h4>Website/Mobile</h4>
			<img src="images/real/real-join.png" alt="join page desktop" class="websitemk">
      <img src="images/real/real-mjoin.PNG" alt="join page mobile" class="mobilemk">
      <img src="images/real/real-mjoin2.PNG" alt="join page mobile" class="mobilemk">
      <h3 id="donate">Donate Page</h3>
      <h4>Mock Up</h4>
      <img src="images/mockups/donatedesktopmockup.png" alt="donate page mockup" class="websitewf">
      <img src="images/mockups/donatemobilemockup.png" alt="donate page mockup" class="mobilewf">
      <p>The Donate Page layout was kept the same but DesCo removed the breadcrumps navigation as we felt it was unnecessary. There would only be two sections for the breadcrumps, which led to the decision to remove the breadcrump navigation overall. The mobile version was kept the same. There was an added feature to the page where the user would be prompted with a message saying 'Thank you!' to alert the user it worked.</p>
      <h4>Website/Mobile</h4>
			<img src="images/real/real-donate.png" alt="donate page desktop" class="websitemk">
      <img src="images/real/real-mdonate.PNG" alt="donate page mobile" class="mobilemk">
      <img src="images/real/real-mdonate2.PNG" alt="donate page mobile" class="mobilemk">  <h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>  
      <h4>Mock Up</h4> 
      <img src="images/mockups/navigation.png" alt="navigation mockup" class="mobilemk">
      <p>The navigation bar was kept the same for all desktop pages, however for the mobile, it had to be changed due to the Join and Donate buttons not being able to be placed in the list with the hamburger menu. To solve the issue, DesCo created a new page that resembled a menu for mobile users. The hamburger menu icon was removed and replaced with the text, 'Menu', to make it simple and understanding.</p>

			<h2>Issues</h2>
      <p>The main issuses revovle around the web responsiveness to mobile usage. These issues include:</p>
			<ul>
        <li>The video on the About Page had issues centering on mobile.</li>
        <li>The panels on the Campaign Page on the mobile did not align with one another and kept overlapping at 480px but at 767px it functioned nicely.</li>
        <li>The alignment of the checkboxes on the Join Page was not straight.</li>
        <li>The mobile navigation caused a lot of issues due to the Join and Donate buttons not being in a list along with the About and Campaigns links. This prevented the hamburger menu being applied to the mobile version.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Future works</strong> aims for DesCo to learn and fix these issues and refine the website more.</p>
